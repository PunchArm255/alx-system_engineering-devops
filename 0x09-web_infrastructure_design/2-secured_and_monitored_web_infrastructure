The firewall:
- The firewall implements Access Control, Packet Filtering, Network Address Translation (NAT), and Intrusion Prevention and Detection.

Reasons for serving traffic over HTTPS:
- HTTPS ensures Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Trust, Protection Against Interception and Manipulation, and Compliance with Regulatory Requirements.

Purpose of monitoring:
- Monitoring is employed to analyze server performance and operations, gauge overall health, and notify administrators of any deviations from expected performance.

Challenges with terminating SSL at the load balancer level:
- Terminating SSL at the load balancer leaves the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data.

Issues with having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes:
- Relying on a single MySQL server for write operations poses a risk; hardware failure, software errors, or other issues could render the server unavailable, disrupting service and risking data loss.

Concerns regarding servers with identical components (database, web server, and application server):
- Homogeneous server setups may lack flexibility to accommodate varying workload demands or scaling requirements. Managing such environments can become complex, involving challenges in configuration management, software updates, and troubleshooting.
