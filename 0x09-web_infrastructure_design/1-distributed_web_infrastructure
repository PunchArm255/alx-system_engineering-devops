Load Balancer:
- HAProxy load balancer utilizes the Round Robin distribution algorithm to manage connections between clients and applications.

Active-Active or Active-Passive setup for load balancer:
- The choice between Active-Active and Active-Passive setups depends on the specific system requirements. Active-Active configuration suits high-traffic environments with demanding performance needs, while Active-Passive configuration is preferred for prioritizing high availability and fault tolerance.

How does a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster operate?
- In a Primary-Replica setup, one server is designated as the Primary server, responsible for write operations, while the other server acts as a Replica, maintaining data consistency and serving as a read replica to enhance read scalability.

What distinguishes the Primary node from the Replica node concerning application functionality?
- The Primary node manages write operations and ensures data consistency, whereas Replica nodes function as read replicas, enhancing read scalability and relieving the Primary node of read traffic.

Infrastructure issues:
- Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) can manifest across various infrastructure components, encompassing hardware, software, network, and architecture.
- Security vulnerabilities arise from the lack of SSL encryption for transmitted data, enabling potential network eavesdropping by hackers. Additionally, the absence of a firewall across servers impedes the ability to block unauthorized IPs.
- Monitoring deficiency leaves servers untracked, preventing insights into their operational status and performance.
